description: Hi there! I am a researcher and lecturer at the University of Zambia. I also currently work as the Assistant Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences. In my mind, I am an accomplished inspirational and keynote speaker as well as an author.

If the world was fair, I would spent my life working on amazing research projects and teaching research methods and computational social science. But the world being what it is, I often find myself doing things which I don't really like. In this website you will find projects I work on, my teaching, publications and reflections these and many other topics.
